          <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup will not only be the first tournament to be held in the Arab region, but it will be the most compact, allowing fans to attend more than one game a day.</p>
          <p>With high summer temperatures, each stadium, training facility and fan zone is equipped with solar-powered cooling technology to keep the temperature at 27C. All stadiums are eco-friendly and their temperature will be controllable.</p>
          <p>Qatar is home for less than 3 million people, so the legacy of the tournament has to be managed carefully. To that end, the tournament organizers have pledged to build stadiums with modular elements, which will be reconfigured after the tournament to provide a lasting legacy for the 2022 FIFA World Cup far beyond Qatar’s borders.</p>  
          <p>After the tournament, around 170,000 seats will be disassembled and provided to developing nations to help develop their sports infrastructure. As many as 22 new stadiums will be created in emerging economies, and this reconfiguration will leave Qatar with stadiums between 20-25,000 seats, which are suitable for its domestic entertainment needs.</p>

               <p>Al Thumama Stadium is a distinct Arab architectural icon, as it is inspired by the traditional qahfiya (the cap worn under the Ghutra and Egal) in the Arab world. This design was chosen because it is a cultural commonality among Arabs in the Arab world. Therefore, it expresses the Arab civilization's depth and the intertwined cultural-historical legacy of the Arab countries.</p>
               <p>The stadium is located in the southern districts of Doha, several minutes away from Hamad International Airport, and has a capacity of at least 40,000 seats that will be reduced after the tournament to 20,000 and donated to developing countries.</p>
